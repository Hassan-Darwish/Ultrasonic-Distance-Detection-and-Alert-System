# Ultrasonic Distance Detection and Alert System

This project is an AVR microcontroller-based system designed to measure distances using an ultrasonic sensor and provide visual and auditory alerts based on predefined thresholds. It features real-time distance display on an LCD and dynamic signaling with LEDs and a buzzer.

## Features

### Distance Modes:
- **EXTREMELY_NEAR**: Activates all LEDs and buzzer with a flashing effect.
- **NEAR**: Activates all LEDs without the buzzer.
- **MODERATE**: Activates the red and green LEDs.
- **FAR**: Activates only the red LED.
- **VERY_FAR**: Turns off all LEDs and the buzzer.

### User Input Controls:
- Continuous distance measurement with real-time updates.
- Dynamic display adjustment for 1, 2, or 3-digit distances.

### Visual and Auditory Feedback:
- **LCD**: Displays the current distance in centimeters.
- **Buzzer**: Sounds an alert for close distances.
- **LEDs**:
  - RED LED for various distance ranges.
  - GREEN and BLUE LEDs for additional visual feedback.

## Components Required

### Microcontroller:
- ATmega32.

### Sensors:
- Ultrasonic sensor (e.g., HC-SR04).

### Display:
- 16x2 LCD.

### Outputs:
- **Buzzer** for audio feedback.
- **LEDs** (RED, GREEN, BLUE) for distance indication.

### Other:
- Supporting components for interfacing (e.g., resistors, capacitors).

## How It Works

### Initialization:
- Configures input/output pins for controlling the LCD, LEDs, and buzzer.
- Sets up interrupts and libraries for sensor interfacing.

### Modes of Operation:
1. **Distance Measurement**:
   - Continuously reads the distance from the ultrasonic sensor.
   - Displays the measured distance on the LCD.
2. **Alerting**:
   - Activates LEDs and the buzzer based on distance thresholds defined in `main.h`.

### Visual Feedback:
- The LCD displays "Distance= XX cm" with real-time updates.
- LEDs and buzzer provide additional feedback for user awareness.

## Code Overview

The code is written in C using AVR libraries:

### Timer and Interrupts:
- **Timer/Delays**: For stabilizing updates and visual signals.
- **Custom Functions**:
  - `LCD_displayStringRowColumn`: Displays text at specific LCD positions.
  - `LCD_integerToString`: Converts and displays integer values.

### Modules Used:
- **LCD Module**: Manages the LCD display.
- **Ultrasonic Module**: Handles distance measurement.
- **LED Module**: Controls LEDs based on distance ranges.
- **Buzzer Module**: Controls the buzzer for auditory alerts.
